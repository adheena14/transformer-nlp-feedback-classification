# Transformer-Based Text Classification for Customer Feedback Analysis

Status: In Progress

## Objective
To develop a text classification system using transformer-based models to automatically categorize customer feedback for improved analysis and response prioritization.

## Problem Statement
Organizations receive large volumes of unstructured customer feedback. Manual analysis is inefficient and error-prone. This project aims to automate feedback classification using modern NLP techniques.

## Planned Approach
- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis of text data
- Baseline model using traditional NLP techniques (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression)
- Fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model for text classification
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Error analysis to understand model limitations

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, NLTK

## Expected Outcomes
- Functional text classification pipeline
- Performance comparison between classical and transformer-based models
- Insights into strengths and limitations of transformer models
